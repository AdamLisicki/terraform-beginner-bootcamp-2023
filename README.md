# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023


## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

 **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. So we needed refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking your Linux Distribution and change accordingly to distribution needs.

[How To Check OS Version in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:

```
$ cat /etc/os-release 

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg deprecation issues we noticed that bash scripts steps were a considerable amount more code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI. 

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allow us an easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.


#### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script. eg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it.  

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`
 
#### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash script executable we need to change Linux permissions for the file to be executable at user mode.

```sh
$ chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

alternatively:

```sh
$ chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Gitpod Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when we using Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

### Working Env Vars

We can list out all Environment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`

In the terminal we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
$ HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```
Within a bash script we can set env var without writing export eg.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
HELLO='world'
 
echo $HELLO
```
#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window. 

If you want the Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`


#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars in Gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```sh
$ gp env HELLO='world'
```
All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-sensitive env vars.
