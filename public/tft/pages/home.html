        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is a strategy autobattler that pits players against one another in a series of one-on-one showdowns until a single victor emerges. 
            If you're new to the autobattler genre, fret not! TFT blends various elements familiar to fans of other strategy games, such as selecting from a communal reservoir of options, constructing the perfect team, overseeing your in-game economy, and strategic unit placement. 
            The core of the game involves selecting an ideal set of champions from a common pool, arming them with potent items, wisely spending your gold to outpace opponents, and deploying your team in formations that ensure victory. 
            Since there's no single way to win, you'll find yourself continually adapting and fine-tuning your strategies in each match.
        </p>
        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>
            Each match of TFT unfolds within the Convergence, revolving around a unique theme and narrative termed a 'set'. 
            Periodically, TFT transports players to fresh universes, showcasing novel champions, attributes, and personalities to engage with. 
            From a gameplay perspective, these new sets not only refresh the story but also bring in an updated Ranked progression, innovative team structures, and a plethora of new item opportunities.
            Currently, the TFT set is 9.5 called 'Horizonbound,' and it is part of the mid-set expansion for Runeterra Reforged.
